Project Description: 
- Analyze the relationship between home prices, mortgage rates, treasury yield rate, and loan performance.
- What causational relationships exist between these variables? 

Mortgage Rates vs. Treasury Yields (Erica)
Datasets:  
- Federal Housing Finance Agency; Terms on Conventional Single Family Mortgages, Fixed-Rate 30-YEAR And 15-Year Non-Jumbo Loans; 1990-2019
- US Department of the Treasury; Annual Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates, 2006-2010
 

Relationship between federal fund rates and mortgage performances (Jaxon) 

Trends and fluctuations in mortage rates and home prices throughout the years 2006-2011? (Dmitriy) 

How have home prices trended in all 50 states? (Graciela)

Conclusions: 
 - There is a strong causational relationship between Treasury yield rates and mortgages rates. Even though this relationship weakens during times of great financial upheaval, the pvalue result of a ttest from 2006-2010 is pvalue=3.417893260344795e-20.
